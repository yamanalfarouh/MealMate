Typical User Interactions:
Emma is a busy professional who wants to eat healthier and save time on grocery shopping. She searches for meal planning apps on the Play Store and discovers MealMate. After downloading the app, she registers for an account and logs in.
Inside the app, Emma begins by browsing a selection of recipes. She selects several meals for the week, including "Chicken Stir-Fry," "Vegetable Quinoa Bowl," and "Spaghetti Carbonara." For each recipe, she reviews the ingredients and saves them to her weekly meal plan. The app automatically generates a grocery list that includes all the necessary items, organized by category (e.g., vegetables, grains, proteins).
Knowing that she won’t have time to shop herself, Emma decides to delegate the grocery shopping to her friend, Lily. She selects the grocery list and uses the delegation feature to send her a text message containing the list of items, prices, and a reminder of where to find each item in the local store.

Emma also uses the app’s geotagging feature to mark her favourite grocery stores, so she can quickly find where to purchase specific items. As she shops, she marks items as purchased on her list, ensuring she doesn’t miss anything.
